for the high school Science Olympiad competition. Expected usage is to provide an input file in the form of
a spreadsheet containing information on the performace of students in various events. The program then outputs
another spreadsheet that contains team rosters in descending order based on their expected performance.

<h6>The Input File</h6>

The data is divided into groups of 2 columns, each representing events. The first entry in the group is the name 
of the event, followed by the start time, stop time, and every team and their relative rank to each other.
A sample input file is provided.

<h6>The Output File</h6>
The ouput file takes the format of a chart with event names on the vertical and time frames on the horizontal.
An entry in the chart reflects that those team members are participating in the event at that time. A sample
output file is also provided.
